# üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hey!!! I'm Rose/Golapri (Pritika) Dasgupta, PhD MPH MHI MS

I feel like I am many things, such as: Writer, Visualizer, Health and Disability Advocate, Trans Advocate, Ethical AI User (not a proponent of generative AI with murky, capitalist data sources, but I have a lot of thoughts about AI use in general), Poet, Artist, Data Scientist, Multi-Faceted Creator, Polymath, and Scientist. 

Career-wise, I'm a Data Scientist, Biomedical Informaticist, and Biostatistician with over 15 years of programming expertise and 10+ years conducting statistical analyses (including machine learning!) across healthcare and research institutions. 

I am also a proud queer and neurodivergent Bengali/Indian-American person (my pronouns are: they/them, he/, ze/zir). My journey has been shaped by embracing multiple identities and overcoming significant challenges. Transitioning between academia, industry, and creative outlets while navigating burnout, living with various disabilities, and the complexities of work-life balance, I offer a nuanced perspective on the scientific and creative processes.

... and I really try to bring a unique perspective to my work in healthcare analytics, biomedical informatics, and public health research.

## üß¨ Professional Experience

Most recently, I worked as a Data Scientist and Biostatistician at Magee Women's Research Institute (University of Pittsburgh). I assisted in statistical analysis and machine learning models for predictive analytics in reproductive healthcare while establishing scalable data pipelines for clinical research.

Previously, I served as a Clinical Data Scientist at Northwell Health, leading cross-functional collaborations between clinical staff and IS teams to translate complex healthcare data requirements into actionable analytics solutions. I also worked as a Data Scientist at the University of Pittsburgh's Epidemiology Data Center. I collaborated on clinical trials to optimize data collection workflows, improving trial efficiency and data accuracy.

My doctoral research from 2016-2021, funded by the National Library of Medicine, focused on developing novel deep-learning models for gait and balance analysis. I am particularly proud of my review paper, "Acceleration Gait Measures as Proxies for Motor Skill of Walking: A Narrative Review" (2021).

## ü§ùüèΩ Community Involvement

Although these have become "trendy" and "taboo" words, I'm committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech and healthcare:

- Volunteer at various Pittsburgh organizations
- Former Chair, "Women in Engineering" section, IEEE Pittsburgh Region (2021-2023)
- DEI Committee Member, Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh (2020-2022)

## üß† My Philosophy

I believe in leveraging data science and informatics to improve healthcare outcomes while maintaining a strong commitment to equity and inclusion. As someone who navigates both the technical and human aspects of data science, I strive to build bridges between complex analytical methods and practical, accessible solutions that benefit diverse communities.
